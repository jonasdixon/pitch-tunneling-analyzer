# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone.
Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive. Harassment and discrimination are
not tolerated. If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please
open an issue or contact the maintainers.

Examples of expected behavior:
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on the project, not the person

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, trolling, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

Maintainership decisions are final. Violations may result in warnings or removal
from the community spaces and repositories.
